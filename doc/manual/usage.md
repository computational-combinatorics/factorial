First, require the polyfill at the entry point of your application
```js
require( 'regenerator-runtime/runtime' ) ;
// or
import 'regenerator-runtime/runtime.js' ;
```

Then, import the library where needed
```js
const factorial = require( '@combinatorics/factorial' ) ;
// or
import * as factorial from '@combinatorics/factorial' ;
```
